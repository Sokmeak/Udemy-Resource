  <h2>SHA-256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm</h2>
</header>

<p>A <b>cryptographic hash</b> (sometimes called ‘digest’) is a kind of ‘signature’ for a text or
  a data file. SHA-256 generates an almost-unique 256-bit (32-byte) signature for a text. See <a href="#src-code">below</a> for
  the source code.</p>

<form name="f">
  <fieldset>
  <legend>Enter any message to check its SHA-256 hash</legend>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <label for="message">Message</label>
      <textarea name="message" id="message" class="width-full">abc</textarea>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label for="digest">Hash</label>
      <input type="text" name="digest" id="digest" readonly class="width-full">
      <output class="small grey" id="time"></output>
    </li>
    <li><small><i>Note SHA-256 hash of ‘abc’ should be:
        ba7816bf&shy;8f01cfea&shy;414140de&shy;5dae2223&shy;b00361a3&shy;96177a9c&shy;b410ff61&shy;f20015ad</i></small></li>
  </ul>
  </fieldset>
</form>

<p id="error" class="alert"></p>

<p>A hash is not ‘encryption’ – it cannot be decrypted back to the original text (it is a ‘one-way’
  cryptographic function, and is a fixed size for any size of source text). This makes it suitable
  when it is appropriate to compare ‘hashed’ versions of texts, as opposed to decrypting the text
  to obtain the original version.</p>

<p>Such applications include hash tables, integrity verification, challenge handshake authentication,
    digital signatures, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘<i>challenge handshake authentication</i>’ (or ‘challenge hash authentication’) avoids transmissing
    passwords in ‘clear’ – a client can send the hash of a password over the internet for validation
    by a server without risk of the original password being intercepted</li>
  <li><i>anti-tamper</i> – link a hash of a message to the original, and the recipient can re-hash
    the message and compare it to the supplied hash: if they match, the message is unchanged; this
    can also be used to confirm no data-loss in transmission</li>
  <li> <i>digital signatures</i> are rather more involved, but in essence, you can sign the hash
    of a document by encrypting it with your private key, producing a digital signature for the document.
    Anyone else can then check that you authenticated the text by decrypting the signature with your
    public key to obtain the original hash again, and comparing it with their hash of the text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that hash functions are not appropriate for storing encrypted passwords,
    as they are designed to be fast to compute, and hence would be candidates for brute-force attacks.
    Key derivation functions such as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> or
    <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a> are designed to be slow to compute, and are
    more appropriate for password storage (npm
    has <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt">bcrypt</a>
    and <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt">scrypt</a> libraries, and PHP has a bcrypt
    implementation with <a href="//php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php">password_hash</a>).</p>

<p><b>SHA-256</b> is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1 (collectively referred to as SHA-2),
  and is one of the strongest hash functions available. SHA-256 is not much more complex to code than SHA-1,
  and has not yet been compromised in any way.
  The 256-bit key makes it a good partner-function for AES. It is defined in the NIST (National Institute
  of Standards and Technology) standard ‘<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/secure_hashing.html">FIPS
  180-4</a>’. NIST also provide a number of <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/examples.html#aHashing">test
  vectors</a> to verify correctness of implementation. There is a good description at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>In this <b>JavaScript implementation</b>, I have tried to make the script as clear and concise
  as possible, and equally as close as possible to the NIST specification, to make the operation
  of the script readily understandable. </p>

<p>This script is oriented toward hashing text messages rather than binary data. The standard considers
  hashing byte-stream (or bit-stream) messages only. Text which contains (multi-byte) characters
  outside ISO 8859-1 (i.e. accented characters outside Latin-1 or non-European character sets – anything
  with Unicode code-point above U+FF), can’t be encoded 4-per-word, so the script defaults to encoding
  the text as UTF-8 before hashing it.</p>

<p>Notes on the implementation of the preprocessing stage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FIPS 180-4 specifies that the message has a ‘1’ bit appended, and is then padded to a whole
    number of 512-bit blocks, including the message length (in bits) in the final 64 bits of the
    last block</li>
  <li>Since we have a byte-stream rather than a bit-stream, adding a byte ‘10000000’ (0x80) appends
    the required bit “1”.</li>
  <li>To convert the message to 512-bit blocks, I calculate the number of blocks required, N, then
    for each of these I create a 16-integer (i.e. 512-bit) array. For each if these integers, I take
    four bytes from the message (using charCodeAt), and left-shift them by the appropriate amount
    to pack them into the 32-bit integer. </li>
  <li>The <span class="fullwidth">charCodeAt</span>() method returns NaN for out-of-bounds, but the
    ‘|’ operator converts this to zero, so the 0-padding is done implicitly on conversion into blocks.</li>
  <li>Then the length of the message (in bits) needs to be appended in the last 64 bits, that is
    the last two integers of the final block. In principle, this could be done by <br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M[N-1][14] = ((msg.length-1)*8) &gt;&gt;&gt; 32; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M[N-1][15] = ((msg.length-1)*8) &amp; 0xffffffff; </code><br>
    However, JavaScript bit-ops convert their arguments to 32-bits, so n &gt;&gt;&gt; 32 would give
    0. Hence I use arithmetic operators instead: for the most-significant 32-bit number, I divide
    the (original) length by 2^32, and use floor() convert the result to an integer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that what is returned is the textual hexadecimal representation of the binary hash. This
  can be useful for instance for storing hashed passwords, but if you want to use the hash as a key
  to an encryption routine, for example, you will want to use the binary value not this textual representation.</p>

<p>Using Chrome on a low-to-middling Core i5 PC, in <a href="performance/sha.html">timing tests</a>
    this script will hash a short message in around 0.03 – 0.06 ms; longer messages will be hashed
    at a speed of around 2 – 3 MB/sec.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the simpler SHA-1, I have a JavaScript implementation of <a href="sha1.html">SHA-1</a>.
    I have also implemented  <a href="sha512.html">SHA-512</a> and <a href="sha3.html">SHA-3 / Keccak</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in encryption rather than a cryptographic hash algorithm, look at my <a href="tea-block.html">JavaScript
    implementation of TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm)</a> or <a href="aes.html">JavaScript implementation
    of AES</a>.</p>

<p class="production"><span>Note that these scripts are intended to assist in studying the algorithms, not for production use.
    For production use, I would recommend the
    <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest">Web Cryptography API</a> for the browser
    (see <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisveness/e5a07769d06ed02a2587df16742d3fdd">example</a>), or the
    <a href="//nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_hash">crypto</a>
    library in Node.js.</span> For password hashing, I have a WebCrypto
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisveness/770ee96945ec12ac84f134bf538d89fb">example using PBKDF2</a>.</p>

<p id="postscript">See below for the source code of the JavaScript implementation,
    also available on <a href="https://github.com/chrisveness/crypto/blob/master/sha256.js">GitHub</a>.
    §ection numbers relate the code back to sections in the standard.
    Note I use Greek letters in the ‘logical functions’, as presented in the spec (if you encounter
    any problems, ensure your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> includes <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>With its untyped C-style syntax, JavaScript reads remarkably close to pseudo-code: exposing the
    algorithms with a minimum of syntactic distractions. These functions should be simple to
    translate into other languages if required, though can also be used as-is in browsers and Node.js.</p>
